Sacred Engine is a personal project to learn about Vulkan, rendering, and all aspects of creating a 3D game engine. It is not intended to be a fully use-able game engine nor is it intended for public use.

## Notable Features
- Vulkan rendering backend

## Dependencies
Sacred Engine uses the following open-source libraries:
 - fastgltf
 - fmt
 - glm
 - imgui
 - SDL
 - stb_image
 - vkbootstrap
 - vma
 - volk
 
## Requirements
The following is required for building the engine
 - Install vulkan sdk
 - Install cmake gui
 - Install visual studio

## Setup
 - Use cmake gui to configure the project and generate to the /build folder
 - Open with visual studio, build all projects, and set engine as default startup project
 - Engine should now run with f5
 - Note: Adding shaders requires running cmake again and building the shaders project
